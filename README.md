`Semi-ATE` is a tester- and instrument **AGNOSTIC** framework for **<ins>Semi</ins>conductor <ins>ATE</ins> ASIC testing** projects. 

This means that the system is **not** build around a specific instrument (let's consider an ATE tester for a moment as a super instrumentðŸ˜‹), it rather focuses on 
organizing semiconductor testing in such a way that **all** use- (and special) corner cases have their well known place. This enables the users (read: DE's, TCE's, TE's & PE's) to focus on the **REAL** work (respectively: writing fast and stable tests & organizing the tests into test programs).
